- The search functionality is just a form â€” the data will come from inside the form. Based on that data, Django's ORM will be used to perform a search, specifically on the basis of tweet text. Then, a new view needs to be created, and also a new template for displaying the search results.


- the comments functionality is working, created a new model for the comments and a comment form and then added it to views. added the url for the comments. then a new template for the comments using django forms [tweet_detail.html](tweetapp/tweet/templates/tweet_detail.html)
registered this comment model in the admin so that admin can view all the comments.
